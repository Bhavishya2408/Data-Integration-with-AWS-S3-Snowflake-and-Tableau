This project demonstrates the integration of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Snowflake, and Tableau for data storage, transformation, and visualization. The objective was to analyze renewable energy usage and cost savings across various regions and energy sources. The process involved setting up a data pipeline from AWS S3 to Snowflake and visualizing the data in Tableau to provide insights.
Integrating AWS, Snowflake, and Tableau makes it easier to store, process, and analyze data. AWS provides a secure place to store data, Snowflake helps organize and prepare it, and Tableau turns it into clear, interactive dashboards. 
When implemented in industries, this integration facilitates better resource management, drives cost optimization, and enables data-driven strategies across departments. Whether monitoring energy usage, forecasting demand, or analyzing customer behavior, this pipeline offers a robust foundation for scalable analytics solutions.
